        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <h3>Doing the Right Thing Since 1979</h3>
        <p>
          When Chuck Surack first started his mobile recording studio out of the
          back of a Volkswagen bus, he quickly realized his customers needed
          access to a wider selection of quality instruments, expert service,
          and amazing support – all notably missing from music stores in their
          hometowns. To better serve them, Chuck started Sweetwater Sound with a
          focus on providing everything music makers need – and more. From these
          humble beginnings, Sweetwater has grown into an industry leader
          serving millions of customers and employing a team of thousands.

    <h2>Fairness and Respect</h2>
    <p>
      After more than 40 years in business, we have seen the political and
      social landscape shift time and again. Sweetwater has been and will
      continue to be a company committed to one very simple principle: Always Do
      The Right Thing. We've committed this belief to the fabric of how we
      choose to do business.
    </p>
    <p>
      We absolutely, unequivocally believe in treating every person fairly and
      with respect — regardless of race, color, religion, sex (including
      pregnancy, sexual orientation or gender identity), national origin, age,
      disability or political preferences. This begins with our employees and
      extends to our valued customers. We do not condone or accept
      discrimination in any form. No matter the issues, we will stay the course
      and continue to simply do the right thing — with compassion, with
      integrity, and most certainly, without bias.
